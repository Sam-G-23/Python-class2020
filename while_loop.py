This code is designed to take user input, store it in some variable, and output a randomly generated number.
Assuming strings are not used code should work fine.

def main():
    store_variable = []
    sentinel_value = 99
    while True:
        user_input = input("Please input a number between 1 and 100. Input 99 if you want to stop.")
        try:
            user_input = int(user_input)
        except ValueError:
            print('Not correct format or integer(s).')
            return main()
        if user_input == 99:
           print('Goodbye.')
           break
        if 0 < user_input <= 100 or user_input :
            print("Thank you. This number is added to the list.")
            store_variable.append(user_input)

# Attempting to make this as realistic as possible and what I imagine a real albeit shorter version of a function

# I am unsure of a way to ensure both a quality integer is inputted and to ensure that a string is pushed back
# Going to have to ask the class about this one.
